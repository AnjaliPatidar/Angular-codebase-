                  "description": "Came here a few years ago with one of my best friends and we had suuuuuuuuch an amazing time!\n\nIt was nighttime and while we had both done some research on some supposedly hoppin' places we ended up getting disappointed by a few. Kaffee Berger made me nervous because yanno, it sounds like \"Coffee Burger\" and while I hold both of these things neat and dear to my heart - they're not necessarily what I think about when I'm looking for a place to shake my tailfeather.\n\nThere wasn't a long line to enter, but there was a cover charge. If I remember correctly, we kindly mentioned that we were from New York at the door (this was garnering lots of positivity everywhere at the time so I figured it wouldn't hurt!) and our cover charge was waived. Huzzah!\n\nIt was a ravey, indie rock dance party a la Misshapes 2004-05. Plenty of lights, lasers, thumping Brit pop/indie rock/dance songs and lots of attractive sweaty bodies dancing as if it were going to be the last night they could dance.\n\nIt was here that I let some guy buy me a beer (I was single and whatevs) and then he made clear that I was to go back to his home and make good on his beer purchase. I educated him and made it clear that isn't how I roll, he should never assume that and it's now how things work where I'm from. After some more drunk words from him (I was as sober as Mr. Feeny on \"Boy Meets World\") I asked him to wait for me at a certain spot, rescued my friend from an equally awkward and potentially bad AF situation and we ran outta there.\n\nWe did have an amazing time, hence the 5 stars. I'm not going to hold it against Kaffee Berger if their clients is a bit lame and seems to think girls from NY cost a beer. But yeahhhhh...great scene here and if this party (with AMAZING MUSIC) is reflective of their normal parties (sans loser guys) then this place is a great place to party!",

Usually coming from other bars. Party people.\n\nThere are biers from different types and drinks are affordable with daily specials hanging on the black boards on the walls.\n\nMusic is really good and trendy expect listening good quality housemusic eletro and others",

When I entered, I was instantly charged a cover fee, which was fine except for the fact that my boyfriend and I were the only people charged for the rest of the night. The drinks were a little pricey, but strong. The bartender spoke perfect English, yet was rude to me and my boyfriend. The dj was alright, yet there were only two people dancing on the dance floor the entire time. This was not the fun, up-beat nightlife I expected from Berlin.",

Also good if you're on the pull; but if you're a single woman and not looking to go home with anybody, you might want to change your mind and bring a friend with you, either that, or get good at telling random dudes to piss off.\nThe bar staff and door guys are always chill and respectful. There is also a cloakroom here that is pretty cheap, 50 cents or a euro or so, and you can go and get stuff out of your bag if you like without any attitude from the attendant.\nPeople are generally in a nice mood and happy here, you don't have to be a star to grace the dance floor, which is usually filled with people of all ages and walks of life. A really fun way to spend an evening; no one thinks they're too cool for school hereit's all about having fun and living in the moment.\nImmer gerne wieder, I love the Kaffee Burger.",

                  "description": "Kaffee Burger consists of two parts, the bar area and the dance area, both of which are both enjoyable. The bar area is littered with rounded booths and lows tables complimented by a simple cockatil menu. The dance area has shattered black and white tiles, scattered tables and an old style bar with plenty of service.\n\n\n The best night here is Russen Disko night, where you can hear a Russian DJ bang out the best of the east. Dancing ridiculous required, and bring your super flats for some seriousuhrussian disco dancing? All in all a plus, including the dead animal heads on the walls.",
