Ambani, the brother of one of Asia\u2019s richest men, had been ordered at a February 7 hearing to pay the court $100 million by 4 pm local time (9.30 pm IST) on March 20 (Friday) in order to avoid having his defence struck out.\n\nThe Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China are suing him for more than $700 million (Rs 5,277 crore), including interest, for defaulting on a loan they gave Reliance Communications (RCom) \u2014 now in insolvency proceedings \u2014 in February 2012, which RCom defaulted on. The banks claim Ambani provided a personal guarantee for the loan.\n\nOn Thursday in the Court of Appeal civil division, Lord Justice Flaux refused the Reliance Group chairman permission to appeal the conditional order and refused to stay the proceedings.\n\nFlaux said that \u201cnotwithstanding the length and ingenuity\u201d of Ambani\u2019s arguments, his appeal \u201chas no real prospect of success and is totally without merit. There is no basis for stay of the judge\u2019s order and that part of the application is also refused\u201d.\n\nIn his judgment, Flaux said Ambani had not satisfied the court that he had little or no money and \u201chad no access to assets which could be used to make a payment into court\u201d. Flaux said even though Ambani\u2019s defence was improbable, that did not mean friends and family would not assist.\n\nAmbani argued that the high court judge, Justice Waksman , had made \u201cerrors on facts\u201d in relation to Ambani\u2019s availability of funds from third parties. But Flaux said: \u201cThe judge was entitled to conclude that the defendant had not satisfied him that his brother and other family would not be willing to assist him, by making sufficient funds available, particularly in light of financial assistance they had given in the past ... \u201d\n\n","meta_language":"en","sentimentNews":{"data":{"SentimentScore":{"Neutral":0.9889283180236816,"Negative":0.0068306103348731995,"Positive":0.0042356764897704124,"Mixed":5.37997902938514E-6},"Sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},"status":true},"crawled":"N/A","preference":"0","published":"2020-03-21 02:38:31","thread":{"uuid":"3690787e817801b987f23b24e26a7922"},"entity_id":"232964416CN","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-court-refuses-anils-plea-to-appeal/articleshow/74740699.cms","event_id":8,"entities":[{"EndOffset":46,"BeginOffset":35,"name":"Anil Ambani","type":"PERSON"},{"EndOffset":96,"BeginOffset":90,"name":"Ambani","type":"PERSON"},{"EndOffset":212,"BeginOffset":190,"name":"the UK Court of Appeal","type":"ORGANIZATION"},{"EndOffset":482,"BeginOffset":439,"name":"The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China","type":"ORGANIZATION"},{"EndOffset":507,"BeginOffset":485,"name":"China Development Bank","type":"ORGANIZATION"},{"EndOffset":543,"BeginOffset":512,"name":"the Export-Import Bank of China","type":"ORGANIZATION"},{"EndOffset":681,"BeginOffset":658,"name":"Reliance Communications","type":"ORGANIZATION"},{"EndOffset":687,"BeginOffset":683,"name":"RCom","type":"ORGANIZATION"},{"EndOffset":883,"BeginOffset":849,"name":"the Court of Appeal civil division","type":"ORGANIZATION"},{"EndOffset":903,"BeginOffset":898,"name":"Flaux","type":"PERSON"},{"EndOffset":930,"BeginOffset":916,"name":"Reliance Group","type":"ORGANIZATION"},{"EndOffset":1619,"BeginOffset":1612,"name":"Waksman","type":"PERSON"}],"hash":"03dd3a62142126dac8c7bc21d550b2ce","authors":[]},"_request":"_accepted"}
